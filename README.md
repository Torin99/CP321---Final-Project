## Description
This project aims to provide insights into the Ontario automotive landscape by analyzing data on vehicle models, manufacturers, and various attributes such as manufacturing year, number of cylinders, and body type. Through visualizations and analysis, the project identifies optimal car choices for consumers based on reliability, popularity, and other factors.

## Dataset Information
- **Descriptors.TXT**: Contains information on vehicle types, including body type and number of cylinders.
- **MakeAndModel.TXT**: Contains data on specific vehicle models, including fit cars, wrecked cars, and other statistics.
- **data_dictionary.xlsx**: Provides an explanation of the dataset's contents and structure.

## Imports
The project utilizes various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including pandas, matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn.

## Data Loading
The dataset is loaded into the project using pandas, and preprocessing steps are applied to filter and clean the data for analysis.

## Optimal Manufacturing Year Range
An analysis of the relationship between a car's manufacturing year and its condition is performed to identify optimal manufacturing year ranges for purchasing used vehicles.

## Most Durable Manufacturers
The project identifies the most reliable car manufacturers based on the proportion of active cars to total cars and the total count of active cars on the road.

## Popular and Reliable Car Models
Top car models from the most reliable manufacturers are identified based on the number of fit and active cars on the road.

## Optimal Car Features
A heatmap visualization is used to investigate the relationship between car features such as cylinder count and body type and the percentage of fit and active cars.

## Conclusion
The project concludes by recommending optimal car choices based on the analysis results, including recommendations for specific manufacturers, models, and features.
